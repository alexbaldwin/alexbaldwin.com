In the example it's "what are the main contributing pollutants to global warming", with the follow up being "what are the causes of each pollutant".</p> <p>Slice and filter - Every decision is put within context. Where you see information, you can interact to filter by that aspect.</p> <p>Narrative context - While going through the data, you're going through a story. These real world events are tied to the chart.</p> <p>Emotion - Switching between datasets that can tell a story from different perspectives. Don't let readers sleepwalk through the graphic.</p> <p>When you have the interactive medium you can design a learning curve, similar to game design. Starting a reader off with a basic task and then after awhile let actions grow in complexity.</p> <h3 id=dynamic-data>Dynamic Data</h3> <p>Black box explanations - you don't care about what's going on under the hood, you just want the output. Elements you can adjust and see the consequences of those adjustments.</p> <p>Open box explanations - what's under the hood is exactly what you care about. Explaining how an algorithm works. Nouns are data objects, verbs are the transitions. Series of interactive graphics explaining each step of the process.</p> <p>Making a graphic is not about putting a large spreadsheet in the middle of the page with the data. It's much more so like show and tell. Each cell telling a piece of the story, much like a comic strip.</p> <p>Representations for systems design - Show comparisons between original and intended change. Show the state of the individual steps in a system. Come up with a design language and then show the steps through the system.</p> <h3 id=ladder-of-abstraction>Ladder of Abstraction</h3> <p>The graphics we make for displays must be better than their paper counterparts. By showing an animation, you take away the control that interaction allows.</p> <blockquote> <p>Animations are the pie charts of interactive graphics.</p> </blockquote> <p>First, give readers control over time. Let them move at their own pace and answer their own questions as they arise.</p> <p>Second, give control over each of the parameters while abstracting time. When you control a parameter, you need to be able to see the result. Be able to see the entire behavior over time.</p> <p>Third, give control back by letting the reader control time and variable by marrying them together.</p> <p>See also — <a href="acko.net">Steven Wittens</a>, <a href="redblobgames.com">Amit Patel</a></p> <h2 id=mike-bostock-new-york-times>Mike Bostock, New York Times</h2> <p>If one of the best designers of all time doesn't know if what he makes is good, how can anyone else expect to?</p> <blockquote> <p>Good design is as little design as possible. - <cite>Dieter Rams</cite></p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitt's law</a>, it's easier to click on targets that are closer and bigger.</p> <p>Two phases: create and edit.</p> <p>Get fresh eyes frequently; invite criticism.</p> <p>New York Times Preview tool, displays all of the ongoing work.
