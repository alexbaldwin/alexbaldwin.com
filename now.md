description: What Alex Baldwin is currently working on - design consulting, sharing design learnings, and recent projects.

Here's a little bit of what I've been up to recently:

## Product design

Currently, I'm a designer at Perplexity. My primary role is with the growth team working to scale both the answer engine and our browser, Comet.

## Sharing design learnings

Since 2014, I've been helping out with [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org). Currently looking for curators to produce new lessons with.

## Keeping up with friends

Almost every day I post a photo to [3pm](https://three.pm), a photo service, that I've been running for the past few years. You can upload a photo every day and you receive a roll up of your friends photos at 3pm. That's the whole service.

### Questions on my mind

- Is math real or merely useful?
- What's the next major UI pattern after the feed?
- Can LLMs effectively curate?
