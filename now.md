Here's a little bit of what I've been up to recently:

## Design consulting

Working through Simple Casual, I've partnered with Justin Graham to collaborate with clients on special projects. Our sweet spot is delivering new products and optimizing existing workflows for companies with lots of leverage.

## Sharing design learnings

Since 2014, I've been helping out with [Hack Design](https://hackdesign.org). Currently looking for curators to produce new lessons with.

## Keeping up with friends

Almost every day I post a photo to [3pm](https://three.pm), a photo service, that I've been running for the past few years. You can upload a photo every day and you receive a roll up of your friends photos at 3pm. That's the whole service.

### Recent lil' projects

- Reading the latest papers on recommendation algorithms.
- Rebuilding a Seiko 6118 watch with a new NH35 movement.
- Restoration work on Copal Caslon 601 clocks.
- Migrating Hack Design from Rails to Jekyll.
