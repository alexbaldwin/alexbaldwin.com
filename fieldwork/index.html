No longer was it acceptable to shrug at a user interface's holistic performance. All it took was a day a month he said. Bring subjects in and test the site's performance. Be careful he warned, you're testing the site not the users.</p> <p>However useful this is in the right context, it still feels sterile bringing in randoms off Cragislist and subjecting them to the battery of tests. You're asking the same questions, talking off the same script, and people are still uncomfortable. The environment in which they actually make decisions is suspiciously absent.</p> <blockquote> <p>Today, scientists are more and more aware that what things are, and what they are doing, depends on where and when they are doing it. If, then, the definition of a thing or event must include definition of its environment, we realize that any given thing goes with a given environment so intimately and inseparably that it is more difficult to draw a clear boundary between the thing and its surroundings. - Alan Watts</p> </blockquote> <p>Missing the context of the situation is half of the problem equation. Hoping to solve the solution without it is a shot in the dark. In order to accurately predict how a problem unfolds and begin to think how to solve that problem, we need to get as close to the context as possible. The context of the situation is everything.</p> <blockquote> <p>Get out of the building. - Steve Blank</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully sociology has realized this over 50 years ago and been refining research methods. You need to do field work and getting closer to the where the problem lies and do some fieldwork.</p> <blockquote> <p>Field research or fieldwork is the collection of information outside of a laboratory, library or workplace setting. The approaches and methods used in field research vary across disciplines. For example, biologists who conduct field research may simply observe animals interacting with their environments, whereas social scientists conducting field research may interview or observe people in their natural environments to learn their languages, folklore, and social structures. - Wikipedia</p> </blockquote> <p>Next up, looking at how to do some fieldwork.</p> </section> </article> <footer class="container center mb4 mt2 clearfix"> <small class="center gray">&copy; 2015 Alex Baldwin.</small> </footer> <script>
