<p>It’s always been slightly frustrating to type on an iPad. Writing notes and jotting in a bit of information isn’t too bad, but you would never want to have it be your primary coding machine. The problem goes away when you have a physical keyboard for the most part, but selecting text was still awful. (Daniel Hooper)[http://twitter.com/danielchooper] has come up with a truly elegant solution worthy of Apple’s attention. Please take a minute and help this come to your iPad.</p>
