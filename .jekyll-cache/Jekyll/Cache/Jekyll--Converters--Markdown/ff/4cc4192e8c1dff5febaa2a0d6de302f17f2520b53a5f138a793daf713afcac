I"à<p>For press releases, advertiser requests, or similar sales campaigns youâ€™re sending a small batch of, usually cold, emails out with a specific ask. Finding potential recipients, writing an email thatâ€™s helpful, and tracking the results doesnâ€™t need to take all day or be painful. Iâ€™ve watched my fellow product people struggle with the pitfalls of outbound; spend all day trying to find emails, copy and pasting boring boilerplate copy, and then never following up.</p>
