<p>From FiftyThree, <a href="http://fiftythree.com/paper">Paper is a drawing app for iPad</a>. Itâ€™s simple, useful, and their business model makes me happy.</p>

<p>As a designer youâ€™re always making concepts and interfaces more human. What doesnâ€™t get as much love is a business model thatâ€™s user centered.  This is what separates the team behind Paper. You download the app for free and start with a single tool, the pen. From there you can play with the watercolor brush, outline marker, and sketching pencil, but you canâ€™t use them in your drawings until you in-app purchase each individually or as a set. Personally I was sold on watercolor (my favorite art medium). Paid apps on the Apple store must be really compelling or highly recommended to purchase, but here I have all the benefits of the free trial period with an obvious upgrade path. Itâ€™s the ultimate in show, donâ€™t tell.</p>

<p>Learning makes selling obsolete, but you <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">probably already knew that</a>.</p>
