I"ø<p>Full-screen gif mayhem. Worked on this one day last year with CH Albach in order
to show it off for a Halloween party. Since the domain is expiring, Iâ€™d prefer
it live on in the lab. It was truly ahead of itâ€™s time, but now <a href="https://staringispolite.github.io/cochlea/">Cochlea</a> and
<a href="http://gj.giphy.com/">Giphy GJ</a> have surpassed itâ€™s meager feature list.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any feature requests.</p>
