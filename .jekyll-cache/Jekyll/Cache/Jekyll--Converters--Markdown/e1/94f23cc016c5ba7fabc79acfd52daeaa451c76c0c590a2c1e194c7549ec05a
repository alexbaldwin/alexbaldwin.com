I";<p>For press releases, advertiser requests, or similar sales campaigns youâ€™re sending a small batch of, usually cold, emails out with a specific ask. Finding potential recipients, writing an email thatâ€™s helpful, and tracking the results doesnâ€™t need to take all day or be painful. Iâ€™ve watched my fellow product people struggle with the pitfalls of outbound; spend all day trying to find emails, copy and pasting boring boilerplate copy, and then never following up.</p>

<p>By stringing together Clearbit Connect, Google Sheets, and Streak, you can knock out these outbound projects super quickly, personalize them, and track progress through a funnel. Iâ€™ll walk you through exactly how it works using my most recent campaign, a sponsorship request for Hack Design.</p>

<h3 id="researching-for-the-right-audience">Researching for the right audience</h3>

<p>First up, youâ€™re looking for the most likely people to be interested. For a press launch, that may be who frequently cover products in that space. In our example, Hack Designâ€™s sponsor list, I was quickly able to look at who else was sponsoring comparable websites. For me, that meant researching the advertisers on Offscreen, Sidebar, Dribbble, recent design conferences and podcasts.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s super simple to save your research and move on to finding the right people at those companies.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start a Google Sheet with the column name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Company</code>.</li>
  <li>Research the companies most relevant to your outbound campaign. Great places to look are Angel List, Product Hunt, job boards (to see who is hiring in a space), Crunchbase, etc. Anywhere that letâ€™s your group and filter through relevant companies.</li>
  <li>Add the company name to your list.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have a list of potential companies, letâ€™s find the emails for the best people to talk to there.</p>

<p>For my Hack Design list, I was lucky and had about a dozen sponsors from previous years. However, since we havenâ€™t accepted sponsorship in over a year, a lot of my contacts at those companies were out of date. This process made it trivial to find the new people in those roles and be able to reach out.</p>

<h3 id="get-the-right-contacts-from-clearbit-connect">Get the right contacts from Clearbit Connect</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Add the column names <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Email</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Full Name</code> to your Google Sheet.</li>
  <li>Install <a href="https://connect.clearbit.com">Clearbit Connect</a> if you havenâ€™t already. This is the secret sauce that will allow you to find anyoneâ€™s email, for free. Connect does have a limit but for small batches, you shouldnâ€™t have any problems. Disclosure: Iâ€™m a small-time investor in Clearbit.</li>
  <li>In Gmail, hit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Clearbit</code> button in the top nav and then press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Find email</code>. Yep, itâ€™s really that easy.</li>
  <li>You must start with the company and then narrow down by name or title. Copy and paste that into your Google Sheet.</li>
</ol>
