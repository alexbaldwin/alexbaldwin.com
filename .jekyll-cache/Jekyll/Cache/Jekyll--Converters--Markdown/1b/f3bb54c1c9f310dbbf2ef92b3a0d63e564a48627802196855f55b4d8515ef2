I"æ<p>Think about this <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/posts/44-rookies-in-the-bike-shed">DHH</a> quote before next time you start creeping towards the bike shed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best developers arenâ€™t the ones who can write the most code in the shortest amount of time or out-reason anyone on the internets. They are the ones that only write the code thatâ€™s most valuable to execute and only enter the debates of high substance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amen.</p>
