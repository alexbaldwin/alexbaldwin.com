  <p>The idea behind hanging punctuation is to put some punctuation characters from start (or to a lesser extend at the end) of text elements ‚Äúoutside‚Äù of the box in order to preserve the reading flow.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>blockquote p {
  hanging-punctuation: first;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since it only applies to quote marks, you can avoid single purpose classes and
trust that your quotes will hang everywhere. Chrome hasn‚Äôt yet implemented the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hanging-punctuation</code> property, but it works perfectly in Safari.

that adds a lot more functionality and will allow you to get cross browser
compatibility.</p>
