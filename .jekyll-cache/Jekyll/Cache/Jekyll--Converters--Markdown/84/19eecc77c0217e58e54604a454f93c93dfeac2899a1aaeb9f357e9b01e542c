<p>Rumors are that Spotify is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/23/spotify-funding/">raising a war chest</a> to combat record labels imminent price rise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the seven months since Spotify launched in the U.S. itâ€™s made huge strides, signing up over <a href="http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/174829003346-spotify">3 million paying  subscribers, and hitting 17.4 million monthly and 5.3 million daily users</a>. Even though the record labels own a stake of the company, Spotifyâ€™s success make it a lucrative target for extortion.</p>

<p>The music content industry is a sinking ship, act accordingly.</p>
