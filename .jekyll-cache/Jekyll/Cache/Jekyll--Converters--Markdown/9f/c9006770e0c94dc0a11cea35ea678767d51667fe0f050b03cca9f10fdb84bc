  <li>no words written whens pictures suffice</li>
  <li>present tense, active language</li>

</ol>

<h3 id="design-ethos">Design ethos</h3>

  <li>speed and <em>deep</em> are not opposites</li>
  <li>cooperation doesnâ€™t mean consensus</li>

  <li>failure is part of the process</li>
  <li><strong>everything restarts as soon as it is finished</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="product-roles">Product roles</h3>
