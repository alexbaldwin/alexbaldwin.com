## Behind the VC Black Box

### Know who your talking to

* follow on twitter
* read blog
* search for more about us
* know the portfolio

**90% of investors you talk to are part of a fund**

> Don’t waste your time asking VCs for seed funding unless you see a strong pattern of seed stage funding.

### Understand difference between LPs and GPs
Investment profile

* what types of companies do they invest in
* investors make promises to their backers

**Funds can be more risky after they’ve paid off principal. ie. when a company gets sold early in the fund.**

> When looking at certain other more colorful companies funding, not everything is logical. There’s always some *pixie dust* going around.

### General Partners

* do the work every day
* 1% of cash in the fund
* work like the founders in a company

### Limited Partners

* 99% of cash in the fund
* Pay annual management fee for office space salaries other operations

### Do your due diligence

* check referrals, verify claims, understand niche more
* as an entrepreneur know what the VC wants

### Understand the value add

* networks
* capital
* relationships
* management support
* portfolio companies

> Work with VCs that when horrible horrible things happen, they are there to support you.

### Growing funding market

* minimum $ amount per investment grows
* higher VC valuations
*  lower returns % on a higher base
* gold rush mentality
* lower funding bar = more risky / copycat ideas

### Shrinking funding market

* minimum $ amount per investment shrinks
* lower VC valuations
* higher returns % on a lower base
* champions mentality
* strongest or most unique idea  / teams

> VCs promise to invest a certain amount of money, they are **ALWAYS** investing, their strategy just changes based on the market.

### Understand if they’re in a position to invest

* when did you close your last fund?
* what was your last investment?

### Understand if they’re a good fit for you

* what is your average investment size?
* how many boards are you on?
* how does your process work?

## Quotables 

> Know how many steps the VC has in the funding process and what 

> Finding VCs is exactly like dating. Don’t always go for the hot girl, sometimes you want the quiet one that makes amazing brownies.

> Big difference between novice entrepreneur and n00bs.

> Raise the next fund as the next big event happens. Same as startups, you raise money when there’s a big press event / launch.

> Angel investing is *always faster* than VCs.

> First contact you do not need to do your whole pitch. Just be authentic and see if it makes sense to send an email or make a phone call to talk more about your startup.
