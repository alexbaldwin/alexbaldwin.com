Rumors are that Spotify is [raising a war chest](http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/23/spotify-funding/) to combat record labels imminent price rise.

>In the seven months since Spotify launched in the U.S. it’s made huge strides, signing up over [3 million paying  subscribers, and hitting 17.4 million monthly and 5.3 million daily users](http://www.appdata.com/apps/facebook/174829003346-spotify). Even though the record labels own a stake of the company, Spotify’s success make it a lucrative target for extortion.

The music content industry is a sinking ship, act accordingly.
