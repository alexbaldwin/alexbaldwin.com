## Growth vs Growth Hacking

[Keith Rabois](https://twitter.com/rabois)

Value => Growth => Growth Hacking

### Lessons

1. First grow based on real value
2. Growth hacking is an observational science
3. Feature design is the new marketing

### Hacks on hacks

* LinkedIn submitting personal profiles to Google
* Pay me with Paypal buttons on eBay
* YouTube embeddable player
* Facebook will proactively send you a new password when you fail to login a few times
* Yammer would get users to sign up and then call their IT department with "Your data is insecure…" once a few users from a company started using the product

> At Square, the brand is more important than any short-term gain.

Organic growth loop at Square was the transaction itself, which was a branded experience. You could actually treat the interaction like an ad impression, and it converted accordingly.

> My job is to add zeroes to the dashboard.

## Understanding the stages of growth

1. Product / market fit
2. Transition to growth
3. Growth

### How do you know you're at PM/fit?

> 40%+ users must be disappointed without it

### Transition activities

* Implement user analytics
* Identify **must have** benefit
* Map benefit to effective hooks
* Optimize business model
* Optimize conversions
* Hire growth team

1. Conversion rate = desire - friction
2. Optimize funnel on delivering must-have benefit

Ask freeform "What is the primary benefit from this product?", after you see patterns emerge, switch to multiple choice.

Free products create demand over-time for premium features.

## How to make your first dollar

Put a tweet on it, no one still wants to get their shoes tied.

### Hustle today

> Coffee challenge: Go to Starbucks and ask for 10% off.

Try it and see what happens. Most people can't even do it. This is step one for aspiring entrepreneurs.

### Validate

1. Do they want it?
2. Will they pay you?

You can validate any product within 48 hours, you don't need code, a business degree, or a co-founder. Just get a yes to those two questions and move onto the next step. Quit wasting months of your time to validate radically simple ideas.

## Habits from inception to adoption

[Josh Elman](https://twitter.com/joshelman)

* Purpose: What need do you solve?
* Inception: How can you make users *aware*?
* Adoption: How can you *teach* users to use it?
* Habits: How can we *keep* them using it?

> SMS is the most underutilized communication medium.

When using invitation emails hint at the solution and benefit to hint at how potential users should use the platform.


## Building the growth machine

[Elliot Shmukler](http://www.linkedin.com/in/eshmu)

1. Set growth goal
2. Understand drivers
3. Optimize

### Goals

* must be measurable
* be measurable quickly (Facebook's 10 friends in **13** days)
* align goal with product / business
* make it a single number

### Understand drivers

Draw a diagram of all the possible flows of getting to the purpose

* work backwards from the goal
* understand the steps to get there

### Optimize

1. Reduce friction, make it simpler
2. Increase incentive, give me a better reason
3. Increase exposure, more often, more prominently, or in more places

Micro-questions, reduce friction by breaking out forms. You need all the data, but not all at once. Chip away at the problem.

## Email: unglamorous, difficult, effective

[Mike Greenfield](http://numeratechoir.com/)

Fix your email funnel and optimize in the order of magnitude of holes in your funnel. For example, only 20% of our emails got to Yahoo Mail users, by switching service providers we were able to get that number to 100%.

1. **Inbox delivery**, *make sure everyone is getting your email*
2. **One item focus**, *have one main hero piece of content*
3. **Quality**, *highly curated content > user generated*
4. **Subject optimization**, *test many lines and send the best one*
5. **Winners and losers**, *quit sending loser emails*
6. **Personalization**, *use relevant segmenting*
7. **Frequency**, *send more than you think*
