	<p>Why hello there, I'm Alex Baldwin. I design and develop <%= link_to 'products for the internet', '/products' %> using wit & charm. When I'm not doing that, you can find me climbing things in nature, disc jockeying, drinking lattes, or even possibly cartwheeling.</p>

	<p>Even about me though, let's talk about you. Say hello on <%= link_to 'twitter', 'http://twitter.com/alexbaldwin' %>, or if you're old school we can always use <%= mail_to 'alexbaldwin@gmail.com', 'electronic mail' %>.</p>
