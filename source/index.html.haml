  %h3.p.caps.regular.light-gray.crossbar About
  %p
    Why hello there, I'm Alex Baldwin, I live and work in San Francisco, California.
  %p
    Previously I've worked as a designer-in-residence with
    Techstars and 500 Startups running design sessions,
    prepping pitch decks, and shipping an insane amount of
    landing pages. My focus is in product design (a
    combination of user interface, interaction, marketing, and
    graphic design), however, when I'm not doing that, you can
    find me climbing nature, disc jockeying, drinking lattes, or
    possibly cartwheeling.
