Building on top of user interface patterns and trying to follow the inspiration of pixel masters is all in a good day's work being a designer. When inspiration eludes you and you have a deadline, what do you do? Well I know that in the past I've for sure copied elements of a design before, but the assets themselves?

Months ago, I was working on an about page for [Console.fm](http://console.fm), an app we put out as part of the [500 Startups](http://500.co) accelerator program. The user interface was finely crafted by 
[Jonno Riekwel](http://jonnotie.nl/portfolio#consolefm), but we didn't have the budget left to have him design an about page. Jonno has a unique clean style, and I was looking through his other apps to find a pattern that would fit. I found inspiration in his [modal window](http://f.cl.ly/items/0C1Y2T2g1P2v130s1n2g/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-19%20at%2010.30.08%20AM.png) for [Shipment](http://shipmentapp.com) and a few hours later had [shipped a page](http://dribbble.com/shots/477308-About-Console-fm) so our users would actually know what the site did.

It was really disappointing to see what I considered some quick work that I put out months ago, be picked up exactly by a new competitor to [Console](http://console.fm). The decision is especially poor considering that we shut down the business around Console within six months of launching the site. It's a solid app, but music is a tough business play.

Here's the quick note I sent to the founders.

> Hey guys, I'm flattered we enjoy the same taste in music and UI. However since your about page is a direct ripoff off [work that I did over six months ago](http://dribbble.com/shots/477308-About-Console-fm), I'm requesting that you guys rework the page.There are numerous styles out there [waiting to be discovered](http://dribbble.com/tags/about). 

> This isn't a legal request, only a professional courtesy. If you're going to copy a design from a fellow startup (especially if you're trying to sell it to others), you might want to steal a more successful one.

> Here's [looking at you](http://i.imgur.com/QbTTn.gif), and hopefully some better user interface for your app.

There's not really any legal action to take regarding copy and layout, it's just a dick move. What irks me the most is that they have a page offering to sell the "theme" for their app.
