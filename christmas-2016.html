            You are wonderful. I tried making this card with crayons and printer
            paper but it's just not my best medium, you deserved better. So I
            decided to cheat and <em>surprise,</em> use the medium I am best at.

            This last year has been so much fun. Since we met, I immediately
            knew you and I were going to become close. The night of our awkward
            dinner before The Revenant, you had me cracking up guessing
            everyone's middle names. Didn't take you very long to get "Scott"
            out of me but the hints did help. Here's what I wrote:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              “Met Stephanie Marie last night, she's good at guessing middle
              names.”

            Although there's not many photos from the first few months of us
            dating, I'm glad we've started to fix that. You even got me to take
            some selfies which is unprescedented. Damn, we look good together.
            It's amazing that all the magical photos in Harry Potter aren't
            selfies. Mugshots don't count.

            Hamilton tickets. No matter where you end up in the next few months,
            you'll have to come back to San Francisco for a weekend. In the

                When you came home with a Christmas tree, I was initially
                slightly skeptical. I don't even decorate normally, none the
                less for holidays. However, walking home from work to the smell
                of a fresh tree and Christmas music playing has been fantastic.
                Your joke about the <em>minimal tree</em> really stuck with me
                and I chuckle every time I think about it now.

                It's a small thing that makes me so happy. We can come up with
                our own traditions that complement both of us so well. Thanks
                for bringing it home, totally worth the struggles and soreness.

            Looking back on our past year of photos, I can't believe how much
            great food we've made together. You really egged me on to cook
            bigger and better things this year. We make magic happen in the
            kitchen.

            You're the best and I can't imagine a life without you. Traveling
            all over, accidentally matching, and cracking dad jokes with you
            can't be beat. I'm so glad I grilled you about sci-fi and that you
            got bored watching <em>Seven Samurai</em>. While I was abroad in the
            spring, despite us spending relatively little time together, I
            thought about you all the time. Our Flora Grubb date while being jet
            lagged was so nice and I was so excited to see you.
