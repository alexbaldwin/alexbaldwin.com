## Jonathan Corum, New York Times

### See

Practice until your **eyes** can see it

See what **others** have done

[See what's **possible**](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)

Look at **more** than you can use

### Think

Find a clear **thought** and get it on paper

Sketching is visual **problem solving**

Sketches are not **commitments**

What are you trying to **do**?

Set the pattern, then show the variations

Ugly is **fine**

Sketch with **data**

Sketch in the **browser**

[Find something your **brain** recognizes](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html)

Remember that **aha!** moment

Communicate that **understanding**

### Design

> Good design is clear thinking made visible. - <cite>Edward Tufte</cite>

Design for someone **else**

Don't be your own **audience**

If you're talking to yourself, you're not communicating

[Remember what it's like **not** to understand](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/10/08/science/the-higgs-boson.html#/?g=true)

> If I could have gone back in time, what would help me get to understanding.

[Explain **overview** + relevant **detail**](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2007/12/10/science/20071211_WHALE_GRAPHIC.html)

> In order to get anything out of this [research paper], it's going to be a translation project.

Show **change**

Don't collect **trivia**

> There's a reason that I'm collecting that and then presenting it.

[Collections should **add up** to something](http://13pt.com/projects/nyt110705/)

[Visualization **&ne;** counting](http://projects.nytimes.com/guantanamo)

Find and show meaningful **patterns**

Avoid the **language** of infographics

> Avoid the [facade of communication](https://vimeo.com/64377100).

Don't introduce **false patterns**

> Is this pattern a true pattern or an artifact of how I arranged the data?

Visualization **&ne;** explanation

Don't count **diapers**!

Be skeptical of [**vanity** data](https://www.facebook.com/Yankees)

[Compared to **what**?](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/24/upshot/facebook-baseball-map.html)

### Produce

> When your idea hits the real world.

[Embrace **limitations**](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/02/19/sports/olympics/olympics-frame-by-frame.html?gwh=90E8664173E76317ED3987083E4E07B3&gwt=pay)

Point and **annotate**

> Put the text where it's relevant.

Combine **art** + **label**

Anticipate **confusion**

> It doesn't say here's some lines, now you figure it out.

Help the **reader** through

Keep **honing** your ideas

> We are not designers! - <cite>Matthew Ericson</cite>

Ruthlessly apply **common sense**

Brute **force** works but **tools** can help

Understand every **step** *in the process*

Understand what you can **control**: *accuracy, clarity, legibility, empathy, and simplicity*

What might **emerge**? *Understanding, elegance, and beauty.*

> What if I am tricked? What if I believe in this just because it is beautiful? - <cite>Andre Lim</cite>

See &amp; think = understand

Design &amp; product = explain

Understand then explain

Respect the **reader**

1. Static displays
2. Dynamic displays
3. Dynamic data

### Dynamic Displays

Summary and detail graphics - Two levels of questions for different readers. In the example it's "what are the main contributing pollutants to global warming", with the follow up being "what are the causes of each pollutant".

Slice and filter - Every decision is put within context. Where you see information, you can interact to filter by that aspect.

Narrative context - While going through the data, you're going through a story. These real world events are tied to the chart.

Emotion - Switching between datasets that can tell a story from different perspectives. Don't let readers sleepwalk through the graphic.

When you have the interactive medium you can design a learning curve, similar to game design. Starting a reader off with a basic task and then after awhile let actions grow in complexity.

### Dynamic Data

Black box explanations - you don't care about what's going on under the hood, you just want the output. Elements you can adjust and see the consequences of those adjustments.

Open box explanations - what's under the hood is exactly what you care about. Explaining how an algorithm works. Nouns are data objects, verbs are the transitions. Series of interactive graphics explaining each step of the process.

Making a graphic is not about putting a large spreadsheet in the middle of the page with the data. It's much more so like show and tell. Each cell telling a piece of the story, much like a comic strip.

Representations for systems design - Show comparisons between original and intended change. Show the state of the individual steps in a system. Come up with a design language and then show the steps through the system.

### Ladder of Abstraction

The graphics we make for displays must be better than their paper counterparts. By showing an animation, you take away the control that interaction allows.

> Animations are the pie charts of interactive graphics.

First, give readers control over time. Let them move at their own pace and answer their own questions as they arise.

Second, give control over each of the parameters while abstracting time. When you control a parameter, you need to be able to see the result. Be able to see the entire behavior over time.

Third, give control back by letting the reader control time and variable by marrying them together.

## Mike Bostock, New York Times

If one of the best designers of all time doesn't know if what he makes is good, how can anyone else expect to?

> Good design is as little design as possible. - <cite>Dieter Rams</cite>

[Fitt's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law), it's easier to click on targets that are closer and bigger.

Two phases: create and edit.

Get fresh eyes frequently; invite criticism.

New York Times Preview tool, displays all of the ongoing work. Can switch between each branch and interact with works in progress. Takes a snapshot of each commit on each branch.

Prototypes should emphasize speed over polish.

Transition from exploring to [refining near deadline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).

Delete code as you go. Be ruthless.

**Make** your process reproducible.

Try bad ideas deliberately.

Don't be afraid to fail.

* > What was observed by us in the third place is the nature or matter of the Milky Way itself, which, with the aid of the spyglass, may be observed so well that all the disputes that for so many generations have vexed philosophers are destroyed by **visible certainty**, and we are liberated from wordy arguments. - <cite>Galileo Galilei</cite>

1. Seek verbs and actions.
2. See now, words later.
4. A sense of the relevant.
5. Seek forever knowledge with a taste for excellence.
6. Understanding the difference between evidence and inference.
