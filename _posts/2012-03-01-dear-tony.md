Over a year ago, I was sent this e-mail from Tony Conrad, the founder of [About.me](http://about.me) in response to a weekend project we made called [Why Hello](http://whyhello.im).

Let's be very honest here, it was a shameless ripoff and in no way am I arguing that Tony is wrong. It's really interesting though that he sent this over three months [after they were acquired by AOL](http://mashable.com/2010/12/20/about-me-acquired/). Also curious is that About.me is almost a literal clone of Flavors.me, which [predates them by over a year](http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/23/flavors-me-build-profile/).

So Tony,  I'm sorry for cloning your clone, lunch is on me next time.
