Think about this [DHH](https://david.heinemeierhansson.com/posts/44-rookies-in-the-bike-shed) quote before next time you start creeping towards the bike shed.

> The best developers aren't the ones who can write the most code in the shortest amount of time or out-reason anyone on the internets. They are the ones that only write the code that's most valuable to execute and only enter the debates of high substance.

Amen.
