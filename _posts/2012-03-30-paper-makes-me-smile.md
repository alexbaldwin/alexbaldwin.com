From FiftyThree, [Paper is a drawing app for iPad](http://fiftythree.com/paper). It's simple, useful, and their business model makes me happy.

As a designer you're always making concepts and interfaces more human. What doesn't get as much love is a business model that's user centered.  This is what separates the team behind Paper. You download the app for free and start with a single tool, the pen. From there you can play with the watercolor brush, outline marker, and sketching pencil, but you can't use them in your drawings until you in-app purchase each individually or as a set. Personally I was sold on watercolor (my favorite art medium). Paid apps on the Apple store must be really compelling or highly recommended to purchase, but here I have all the benefits of the free trial period with an obvious upgrade path. It's the ultimate in show, don't tell.

Learning makes selling obsolete, but you [probably already knew that](http://headrush.typepad.com/).
