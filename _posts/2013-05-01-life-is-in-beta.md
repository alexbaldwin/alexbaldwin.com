Erik Spiekermann goes through his firm's entire design process. Decades of knowledge in less than an hour.

### Writing copy

1. no ornamental adjectives
2. no self-praise
3. hard facts as proof of concept
4. no words written whens pictures suffice
5. present tense, active language
6. subheads as teasers
7. 800-1200 characters (200 words)
8. one editor who writes final version

### Design ethos

* speed and *deep* are not opposites
* cooperation doesn't mean consensus
* idea generation is not idea selection
* failure is part of the process
* **everything restarts as soon as it is finished**

### Product roles

* **no** project manager
* Product owner is the *CEO*, they manage product and deadlines (doesn't matter who it actually is)
* Scrum master is the facilitator, coach, and bulldozer, they manage process
* Team self-manages to the owner for delivering as promised
