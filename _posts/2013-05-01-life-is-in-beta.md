Erik Spiekermann goes through his firm's entire design process. Decades of knowledge in less than an hour.

### Writing copy

1. no ornamental adjectives
2. no self-praise
3. hard facts as proof of concept
4. no words written whens pictures suffice
5. present tense, active language
6. subheads as teasers
7. 800-1200 characters (200 words)
8. one editor who writes final version

### Design ethos

- speed and _deep_ are not opposites
- cooperation doesn't mean consensus
- idea generation is not idea selection
- failure is part of the process
- **everything restarts as soon as it is finished**

### Product roles

- **no** project manager
- Product owner is the _CEO_, they manage product and deadlines (doesn't matter who it actually is)
- Scrum master is the facilitator, coach, and bulldozer, they manage process
- Team self-manages to the owner for delivering as promised
