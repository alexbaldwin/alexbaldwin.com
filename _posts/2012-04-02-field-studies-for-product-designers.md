Where do you go to learn product design? It's a constant juggling act between many subdiciplines of design and development that no one does quite the same as the next. Enter Three Point Line, where they are releasing field studies of other product designers and documenting their thought processes.

Their first field study with Skillshare is launching this spring. Be [notified when they launch](https://threepointline.cc/).
