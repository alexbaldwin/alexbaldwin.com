> The hanging-punctuation property aims at giving web web designers a finer grained control over typography on the web.

> The idea behind hanging punctuation is to put some punctuation characters from start (or to a lesser extend at the end) of text elements "outside" of the box in order to preserve the reading flow.

```
blockquote p {
  hanging-punctuation: first;
}
```

Since it only applies to quote marks, you can avoid single purpose classes and
trust that your quotes will hang everywhere. Chrome hasn't yet implemented the
`hanging-punctuation` property, but it works perfectly in Safari.
[Typeset.js](https://github.com/davidmerfield/Typeset) is an HTML pre-processor
that adds a lot more functionality and will allow you to get cross browser
compatibility.
