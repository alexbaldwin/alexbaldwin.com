Web fonts are slowly taking over, despite the lack of pixel perfection on the web. [Cameron Moll](http://cameronmoll.tumblr.com/post/22778583204/chartwell) posted about the new FF Chartwell, which turns number values into beautiful information graphics. The appeal of using this only in Photoshop is huge, but add in the possibility of using it on the web and we just eliminated the need for another few javascript libraries in our apps. Designer, [Yaron Schoen created a demo](http://yaronschoen.com/chartwell-demo/) of a what the web version could  be. Although it's not quite ready for production use, [the author states that OT support in browsers is currently holding FF Chartwell back](https://twitter.com/#!/traviskochel/status/203158700427456512) from a web version, I'm looking forward to having a charting tool I can use universally despite what device I'm designing for. You have to [see FontFont's video to believe it](http://vimeo.com/41772735).
