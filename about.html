  <p>
    Currently, I'm helping build the future of AI-powered search at Perplexity,
    where I work as a product designer and UI engineer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Prior to that, I served as designer-in-residence with both Techstars and 500
    Startups, where I ran design sessions, prepped pitch decks, and shipped what
    felt like an endless stream of landing pages for ambitious founders. Through
    my design studio Simple Casual, I've worked with clients such as Flipboard,
    Coinbase, and Grammarly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2013, I co-founded Hack Design, an educational platform that's taught
    design fundamentals to over 20,000 developers through curated lessons from
    top designers. I'm still actively involved, currently seeking curators to
    produce new lessons.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a deep appreciation for recommendation algorithms, vintage Seiko
    watches, the perfect latte, and fixing mechanical clocks. (Also not related
    to Alec Baldwin)
