Not earlier. Not later. Wake up naturally without an alarm clock.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response to the resurgance of Supermemo's popular <a href="http://www.supermemo.com/articles/sleep.htm#Free_running_sleep">free running sleep</a> article, it was time for a test run. Previously I've tried polyphasic and biphasic sleep to optimize my life with varying degress of success.</p> <p>Here's the rules I set for a two-week free running sleep experiment;</p> <ul> <li>No alarm clock</li> <li>Retire nightly around 9pm</li> <li>No caffiene after 11am</li> <li>Only drink alcohol that will metabolize before sleep</li> <li>Move exercise to the morning</li> </ul> <p>After two weeks, what I found is that free running sleep forces me to assume responsibility for my sleep, rather than simply relying on the alarm and accepting that I will be groggy all day. Normally I ended up going to bed around 11pm and waking up before 8am, which never happens. Usually I would consider myself a late riser, working until 2am and then sleeping in until the crack of noon. At no point during my experiment did I sleep past 10am and that was one time due to breaking my alcohol rule.</p> <p>Unexpectedly my dream recall was near flawless, twelve out of fourteen mornings I was able to record a dream journal entry. Not only was my recall more frequent, but more descriptive as well. Looking back at my entries they were quite a bit longer than normal.</p> <p>It's been about a month since I started the experiment and I'm still going strong. I found myself to have better control over my sleep, dream recall, and energy during the day.</p> <p>Remove the first annoyance of your day and be better for it.</p> </section> </article> <footer class="container center mb4 mt2 clearfix"> <small class="center gray">&copy; 2015 Alex Baldwin.</small> </footer> <script>
