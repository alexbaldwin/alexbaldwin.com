It's simple, useful, and their business model makes me happy.</p> <p>As a designer you're always making concepts and interfaces more human. What doesn't get as much love is a business model that's user centered. This is what separates the team behind Paper. You download the app for free and start with a single tool, the pen. From there you can play with the watercolor brush, outline marker, and sketching pencil, but you can't use them in your drawings until you in-app purchase each individually or as a set. Personally I was sold on watercolor (my favorite art medium). Paid apps on the Apple store must be really compelling or highly recommended to purchase, but here I have all the benefits of the free trial period with an obvious upgrade path. It's the ultimate in show, don't tell.</p> <p>Learning makes selling obsolete, but you <a href="//headrush.typepad.com/">probably already knew that</a>.</p> <p><a href="//itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812">Download Paper for iPad</a></p> </section> </article> <footer class="container center mb4 mt2 clearfix"> <small class="center gray">&copy; 2015 Alex Baldwin.</small> </footer> <script>
