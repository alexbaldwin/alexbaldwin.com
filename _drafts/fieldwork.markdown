Steve Krug's infusion of usability testing into the web design realm was
transformative. No longer was it acceptable to shrug at a user interface's
holistic performance. All it took was a day a month he said. Bring subjects in
and test the site's performance. Be careful he warned, you're testing the site
not the users.

However useful this is in the right context, it still feels
sterile bringing in randoms off Cragislist and subjecting them to the battery of
tests. You're asking the same questions, talking off the same script, and people
are still uncomfortable. The environment in which they actually make decisions
is suspiciously absent.

Missing the context of the situation is half of the problem equation. Hoping to
solve the solution without it is a shot in the dark. In order to accurately
predict how a problem unfolds and begin to think how to solve that problem, we
need to get as close to the context as possible. The context of the situation
is everything.

Thankfully sociology has realized this over 50 years ago and been refining
research methods. You need to do field work and getting closer to the where the
problem lies and do some fieldwork.

Next up, looking at how to do some fieldwork.
